# twitterwod
For those crossfitters out there who are doing WODs alone and don't know which one you will choose for that day, well I've my solution for you.  Simply using a jquery button, you fire an ajax query to Twitters API, using query string #wod and it spits out all tweets relevant to that.  Later iterations will filter the tweet json object for specific things (e.g. workouts only etc)
